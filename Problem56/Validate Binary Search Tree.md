# SOLUTION

[Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

## Method-1 : Inorder Traversal

### Complexity : Time Complexity : O(n) and space Complexity : O(n)

The inorder traversal of a BST is a sorted list which is the definition of a BST so we can check if BST is valid
using inorder traversal
