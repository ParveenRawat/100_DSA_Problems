# SOLUTION

[word search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

## Method-1 : BackTracking

### Complexity : Time Complexity : O(¯_00*/¯) and space Complexity : O(¯_00*/¯)

we traverse through the vector to search for the first character of the word on match we perform a dfs starting on the current index
in dfs we match adjacent neighbours to next index of word to find the word.
